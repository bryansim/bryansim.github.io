# Hello!
I'm Bryan. 
This is my blog of the following projects (links above)

##### Mediocre Museum
The mediocre part of this project comes from my friend Emilia's and my goal of building the most average artifact possible. We're currently working with open data obtained from the Canada Science and Technology Museums Corporation, obtainable [here][museum].

##### Mousetracker Data
I'm working with friends at the [NYU Couples Lab][coupleslab] to learn more about how people in relationships allocate resources amongsts themselves, and balance self-, altruistic, and group interests.

##### Skytrax Ratings
What makes a good flight Using Skytrax ratings data scrapped by [Quang Nguyen][skytrax], I'm investigating what factors make up a passenger's overall rating, as well as what influences their decision to recommend an airline to others (vs. not).
